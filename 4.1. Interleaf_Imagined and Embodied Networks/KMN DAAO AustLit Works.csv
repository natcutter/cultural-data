",,"1 2   y    Olive Cotton : A Life in Photography   Helen Ennis ,      Pymble  : Fourth Estate , 2019   16573779 2019  single work  biography     Abstract A landmark biography of a singular and important Australian photographer, Olive Cotton, by an award-winning writer - beautifully written and deeply moving. Olive Cotton was one of Australias pioneering modernist photographers, a woman whose talent was recognised as equal to her first husbands, Max Dupain, and a significant artist in her own right. Together, Olive and Max could have been Australias answer to Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera, or Ray and Charles Eames. The photographic work they produced during the 1930s and 40s was extraordinary and distinctively their own. But in the early 1940s Cotton quit their marriage and Sydney studio to live with second husband Ross McInerney and raise their two children in a tent on a farm near Cowra - later moving to a hut that had no running water, electricity or telephone. Despite these barriers, and not having access to a darkroom, Olive continued her photography but away from the public eye. Then a landmark exhibition in Sydney in 1985 shot her back to fame, followed by a major retrospective at the AGNSW in 2000. Australian photography would never be same. This is a moving and powerful story about talent, creativity and women, and about what it means for an artist to manage the competing demands of art, work, marriage, children and family.

In the 1960s, a shift took place in the way Aboriginal women were portrayed, when the Australian artist Margaret Olley [1923-2011] focused upon Aboriginal women differently. She imaged Aboriginal women in terms of painterly aesthetics, ignoring the societal, racial and historical meanings that could have been symbolically attached to her imagery if she had chosen to do so. This article focuses firstly on Olley’s contribution and its interpretation by the Gamilaroi art historian, Donna Leslie. It then extends the investigation of Aboriginal womens portraiture in contemporary Australian art through the exploration of a select group of paintings by the portraitist Julie Dowling (1969-), of the Badimaya people of Western Australia. This article is written by an Indigenous Australian author.

Fiona Foley creates work across media that deal with history, identity, sovereignty and personal signification. In all her work, she insists the viewer re-examine historical stereotypes.
Her national contribution to the arts was recognised when she was awarded the Australia Council artist of the year for 2013.
Throughout her career, Foley has engaged issues of indigenous identity on a regional, national and international level, creating a dialogue with artists and communities here and around the world. In 2013 Foley delivered the keynote address for the Origins Festival of First Nations in London.
In 2009-10, the University of Queensland Art Museum and Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art co-curated a major survey exhibition of Fiona Foley’s work, titled Forbidden.
In 2011, Fiona Foley was appointed an Adjunct Professor with the University of Queensland and her essay, ‘When the Circus Came to Town’ was published in the November issue of Art Monthly.
Recent group shows include the Australia exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and unDisclosed – 2nd National Indigenous Art Triennial.
Recent solo shows include a retrospective at Andrew Baker Gallery as well as a show at CAST in Tasmania and Niagara Galleries. Another show of works from her career was exhibited at Redcliffe City Gallery titled Courage.
She has many major public sculpture works including Lie of the Land, Melbourne (1997); Bible and Bullets, at Redfern Park, Sydney (2008); Black Opium, State Library of Queensland, Brisbane (2009) and Blue Water Art Trail, Mackay (2009).
A founding member of the Boomalli artist co-op formed in 1987, Foley has been involved in numerous group projects over the course of her career and has a deep commitment to mentoring the next generation of contemporary Indigenous artists and arts professionals.
In 2020, she released Biting the Clouds: A Badtjala Perspective on the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897 (UQP).

Abstract
Biting The Clouds
A Badtjala perspective on the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897
'In this groundbreaking work of Indigenous scholarship, nationally renowned visual artist Fiona Foley addresses the inherent silences, errors and injustices from the perspective of her people, the Badtjala of K’gari (Fraser Island). She shines a critical light on the little-known colonial-era practice of paying Indigenous workers in opium and the ‘solution’ of then displacing them to K’gari.
Biting the Clouds – a euphemism for being stoned on opium – combines historical, personal and cultural imagery to reclaim the Badtjala story from the colonisation narrative. Full-colour images of Foley’s artwork add further impact to this important examination of Australian history.'

This term, defined as ""a person who deliberately behaves controversially in order to provoke argument or other strong reactions"", is evident in the art she makes, her recent academic career, her public statements, writing and persona. In my recent biography, Fiona Foley Provocateur: An Art Life, I endeavour to describe the courage that this political positioning has always, and continues, to require from her. At its relentless heart is her family lineage which includes notable leaders, especially her mother Shirley Foley, whose vision for land on Kgari involved restoration of Badtjala possession of this special ""paradise."" Fionas fight for justice extends to all Indigenous people, and more broadly to reconciliation, to the embrace of what she describes as the difficult, ""shared"" histories of those descended from Australias Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander nations and incoming colonist and settler populations.

The lives of certain artists are often viewed popularly through the prism of biography. But in the contemporary art world, this perspective is not celebrated. Many art historians argue that the life of the artist should be viewed independently of the art. Indeed in Australia, suggests art historian Dr Sue Best, “This reductive [biographical] approach sheds almost no light on the art, except in some very unusual circumstances”. (Introduction)    1   Foley Gets a Windmill   Keira Jenkins /specialistDatasets/BlackWords ,   2018  single work  column     — Appears in:       Koori Mail  , 25 July       no.      681    2018;   (p. 13)    Abstract Fiona Foley is heading back to Badtjala country after winning the 2018 Windmill Trust scholarship for regional NSW artists.

The tricky manoeuvres of whiteness include its capacity to produce cultures of racialisation that demonise some, while exonerating the riotous behaviours of others. Aboriginal commentaries on the events at Cronulla were scarce, at that time. Since then, Aboriginal artists have provided commentary on the Cronulla riot as part of a wider critique of whiteness and racialisation in Australia. Fiona Foley’s series of photographs titled ‘Nulla 4 Eva’ infuse Aboriginal, Middle Eastern and Asian ethnicities onto the canvas of Cronulla’s whiteness. Vernon Ah Kee’s Cantchant series also provides commentary on the riots. These Aboriginal artists recall that racialised extremism is not a recent or one-off phenomenon in neocolonial Australia, while Sandra Hill’s Homemaker #6: Surfs Up asks who owns the beach? These artworks provide a reminder of the uneasy relationships between the identifications of Aboriginality and the groups that have arrived since invasion. Cronulla ‘ten years on’ was a time to reflect by including some of the understandings and commentaries of those with the longest memories of racialisation and processual whiteness, in Australia.

The art works, the live discussions, the website documenting the project, and finally the book – which reflects upon the art works, artists, the historical context of the work and the university space, are all integral parts of the project. The project invited these artists to reflect on identity, Aboriginality, the Australian nation, Western education, and architecture in the space of The University of Queensland. The book is a collection of essays, reflections and conversations fostered by the Courting Blakness project. (Authors introduction)    1   Courting Blakness : Recalibrating Knowledge in the Sandstone University   Carol Schwartzman ,   2014  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Hecate  ,  vol.       39 no.      1/2    2014;   (p. 206-216)    Abstract The Great Court of The University of Queensland at St Lucia is an everyday agora for students, staff and visitors, and a fondly-appreciated public space. Built and branded to underscore commitment to the development of Queenslands tertiary educational system, to secure the Universitys entry onto the list of elite ""sandstone universities"" dotted across Australia, and to create an iconic symbol of UQs presence,1 (Moore, 19) the Great Court is lovely on a breezy, late spring afternoon, but it is by no means a neutral space/territory for everyone: the St Lucia campus is built upon Jagera and Turrbal country. (Abstract)",Fiona Foley,"Fiona Foley creates work across media that deal with history, identity, sovereignty and personal signification. In all her work, she insists the viewer re-examine historical stereotypes. Her national contribution to the arts was recognised when she was awarded the Australia Council artist of the year for 2013. Throughout her career, Foley has engaged issues of indigenous identity on a regional, national and international level, creating a dialogue with artists and communities here and around the world. In 2013 Foley delivered the keynote address for the Origins Festival of First Nations in London. In 2009-10, the University of Queensland Art Museum and Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art co-curated a major survey exhibition of Fiona Foley’s work, titled Forbidden. In 2011, Fiona Foley was appointed an Adjunct Professor with the University of Queensland and her essay, ‘When the Circus Came to Town’ was published in the November issue of Art Monthly. Recent group shows include the Australia exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts, London, and unDisclosed – 2nd National Indigenous Art Triennial. Recent solo shows include a retrospective at Andrew Baker Gallery as well as a show at CAST in Tasmania and Niagara Galleries. Another show of works from her career was exhibited at Redcliffe City Gallery titled Courage. She has many major public sculpture works including Lie of the Land, Melbourne (1997); Bible and Bullets, at Redfern Park, Sydney (2008); Black Opium, State Library of Queensland, Brisbane (2009) and Blue Water Art Trail, Mackay (2009). A founding member of the Boomalli artist co-op formed in 1987, Foley has been involved in numerous group projects over the course of her career and has a deep commitment to mentoring the next generation of contemporary Indigenous artists and arts professionals. In 2020, she released Biting the Clouds: A Badtjala Perspective on the Aboriginals Protection and Restriction of the Sale of Opium Act, 1897 (UQP).

She shines a critical light on the little-known colonial-era practice of paying Indigenous workers in opium and the ‘solution’ of then displacing them to K’gari. Biting the Clouds – a euphemism for being stoned on opium – combines historical, personal and cultural imagery to reclaim the Badtjala story from the colonisation narrative. Full-colour images of Foley’s artwork add further impact to this important examination of Australian history.

In this sense shale is Tasmania. Layer upon layer. A dark confusion.

I saw more stars than in previous years, and everything seemed crisper, clearer — not only due to upscaling from a HD to a 4k-resolution video camera. The intensity increased as the deadline approached.

At that point I began the long process of trying to understand what had happened that we had almost forgotten ourselves. Fugitive History: The Art of Julie Gough celebrates Goughs art practice, which has been central to her search for, and creation of, an identity for over twenty years. As an Aboriginal woman whose family from Tasmania had moved to Victoria and left behind connections to place and history, this search became as much about negotiating absence, distance, and lack, as discovery. This title includes essays by Brigita Ozolins, artist and senior lecturer at the Tasmanian College of the Arts; James Boyce, author of Born Bad and Van Diemens Land, which won the Tasmanian Book Prize; and Khadija von Zinnenburg Carroll, Professorial Fellow and Chair of Global Art History in the Department of Art, Curating and Visual Studies at the University of Birmingham.

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Barbara Hanrahan was the only daughter of William Maurice ('Bob' ) Hanrahan and his wife Ronda (Goodridge). Her father died of tuberculosis the day after her first birthday. She grew up in her grandmother's house in Rose St, Thebarton with her mother (a commercial artist), her grandmother and her grandmother's sister Reece, who had Down Syndrome, and this background features strongly in her writing. She was educated at Thebarton infant, primary and technical schools. In 1955 she moved to Oaklands Park with her mother and new stepfather. She attended the Adelaide Teachers' College and the SA School of Art. 
Hanrahan began making prints in the early 1960s, and after teaching for a brief period she went to London (1963) and studied at the Central School of Art. After a year back in Adelaide she moved to London again in late 1965, and did not visit Australia again until 1973. As a child she had written and illustrated a novel, Emily of Sunnybrook, in an exercise book, basing it on L. M. Montgomery's Emily of New Moon. When she was about 19 she wrote stories for the Teachers' College magazine, Torch. Then, when she started to make prints, 'words got into them' . Whilst in London she began writing in earnest, when the death of her grandmother in 1968 awakened childhood memories. 'The old world was gone from me physically, yet it was inside my body, hurting so much it had to get out'. 
While appreciating the warmth and security of her childhood home, she rejected what she saw as the suburban mediocrity and conditioned conformity of her mother's and grandmother's lives. She and her partner, the Adelaide sculptor Jo Steele, who had himself reacted strongly against family and social pressures, chose not to marry or have children. In 1975 she taught for a year at the SA School of Art, and in 1978 she and Jo returned from London to live in Adelaide. They set up their studios in Thebarton. Barbara was a prolific artist, producing more than 400 different prints over the years, as well as a number of paintings, and her work was exhibited in Australia, London and France. She held over 30 one-woman exhibitions. She was Writer in Residence at the University of Adelaide for a period in 1987, and later the same year, at Rollins College, Florida (USA). 
In 1991 Hanrahan died of cancer. The Barbara Hanrahan Fellowship, a writing fellowship, has been created by the Arts Division of the SA Department of the Arts and Cultural Heritage, and the University of South Australia's City West campus has named the Barbara Hanrahan Building in her memory.

","1    y    Bee-stung Lips : Barbara Hanrahan, Works on Paper 1960-1991   Nic Brown ,   Jacqueline Millner ,   Elspeth Pitt ,   Barbara Hanrahan   (illustrator),      Mile End  : Wakefield Press , 2021   23427852 2021  selected work  art work  essay     Abstract Barbara Hanrahan (1939-1991), who lived between Adelaide, London and Melbourne, was one of Australias most distinctive artists. Characterised by playfully complex narratives that draw on both personal experience and fantasy, her works are fearlessly direct and unashamedly decorative. Bee-stung Lips reproduces more than 100 of Hanrahans works on paper, while new essays by Nic Brown, Jacqueline Millner and Elspeth Pitt delve into the artists themes, motivations and motifs, affirming the singularity of Hanrahans vision and its relevance to our times thirty years after the artists death in her prime.

Bee-stung Lips reproduces more than 100 of Hanrahans works on paper, while new essays by Nic Brown, Jacqueline Millner and Elspeth Pitt delve into the artists themes, motivations and motifs, affirming the singularity of Hanrahans vision and its relevance to our times thirty years after the artists death in her prime. (Publication summary)    1   Barbara Hanrahan : An Australian Feminist Artist You Need to Know   Melinda Rackham ,   2021  single work  column     — Appears in:       The Conversation  , 3 September   2021;     Abstract A palpable cast of women inhabit Barbara Hanrahan’s oeuvre, joined frequently by their “daddys”, sweethearts, valentines and husbands.     1 4   y    Suburban Space, the Novel and Australian Modernity   Brigid Rooney ,      London  : Anthem Press , 2018   15450833 2018  multi chapter work  criticism     Abstract ‘Suburban Space, the Novel and Australian Modernity’ investigates the interaction between suburbs and suburbia in a century-long series of Australian novels. It puts the often trenchantly anti-suburban rhetoric of Australian fiction in dialogue with its evocative and imaginative rendering of suburban place and time.

It also highlights a preoccupation in her writing with non-normative sexual desires and identities that is akin to the critical concerns of queer epistemologies. The chapter takes Hanrahan’s contestation of normative thinking about sexuality as a starting point to critically examine the queerness of her “fantastic novels”. By reading Hanrahan’s fiction queerly we are offered a valuable critique that challenges the normalising power of heterosexuality and its claims to be the only intelligible and “natural” way to organise desire.

I was standing in a strange hallway. The walls were covered with framed prints of the most absorbing detail and colour. The floors were bare, so it looked like an upside-down house with many rugs up high and the ceiling beneath out feet. The hallway belonged to the sculptor Jo Steele, partner of the late Barbara Hanrahan.

They contest the notion of Australia as an import culture and show Australians exporting literary talent to Britain and further afield from 1820 until the present. Stories of the lives and work of writers working in all genres, from romance and crime to contemporary literary fiction, are interweaved in a collective biography.Bennett and Pender uncover many unknown writers and document their adventures both on and off the page. They also discover the expatriate lives of figures such as Pamela Travers (author of Mary Poppins), Frederic Manning, Randolph Stow and Madeleine St John. They explore the work of lesser known writers such as Jill Neville, as well as investigating Christina Steads expatriate years, the modernist dramas of Patrick White and Barry Humphries, and the arguments with England expressed in the lives and work of Peter Porter, Germaine Greer, Michael Blakemore and Geoffrey Robertson.This book is the first historically comprehensive, detailed examination of expatriate Australian writers at work in Britain. The authors illuminate two centuries of intense literary activity and discover the major contributions by Australian writers to world literature.Source: Monash University Publishing website    1 4   y    Barbara Hanrahan : A Biography   Annette Stewart ,      Kent Town  : Wakefield Press , 2010   Z1771018 2010  single work  biography     Abstract Barbara Hanrahan wrote: It is a struggle ... to be me ... to accept ME, and my spiritual purpose. This authoritative biography illuminates the life of a great Australian writer and artist. The story starts with Barbara Hanrahans childhood in Adelaide, travels with her to swinging London of the 1960s, and recounts her remarkable achievements in Britain and Australia in the following decades. Like the artists she most admired - among them, William Blake, Frida Kahlo and D.H. Lawrence - Barbara Hanrahan dedicated herself uncompromisingly to the life of the mind and spirit, producing a body of work that remains challenging and rewarding. Annette Stewart has drawn on a wealth of unpublished material, including the artists letters, photographs, prints and diaries, as well as interviews with her friends and her partner, the sculptor Jo Steele. Barbara Hanrahan is beautifully illustrated with a number of Hanrahans artworks, some of which have not been published before, and many photographs from her life.

Masgrau-Peya argues that being unhoused for most of their adult lives, Mansfield and Hanrahan eschewed the comforts of either home or conventional family. Their writing, even when recognising the warmth and security of family and the comforts of home also acknowledges the politics of repression, exclusion and exploitation that make them possible.    1   Barbara Hanrahan   Elaine Lindsay ,   2004  single work  biography     — Appears in:       Australian Writers , 1950-1975    2004;   (p. 97-106)      1   In Sunshine or in Shadow   Kerryn Goldsworthy ,   2003  single work  prose     — Appears in:       The Adelaide Review  , March       no.      234    2003;   (p. 8)      1   Home and Away : 1980-2000   Bruce Bennett ,   2002  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Australian Short Fiction : A History    2002;   (p. 225-290, notes 352-353)      1    y    Masterpieces: The Representation of Maternal Subjectivity in the Art of Seven Late Modern Women Artists   Julie Rosewarne Foster ,     2001   Z979193 2001  single work  thesis       1   Barbara Hanrahan : Held in the Eye of God   Elaine Lindsay ,   2000  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Rewriting God : Spirituality in Contemporary Australian Womens Fiction    2000;   (p. 213-276; bib.288-293)      1    y    Barbara Hanrahans Scent of Eucalyptus Walk in Thebarton   Glen Ralph ,      Lockleys  : Wilmar Library , 2000   Z862961 2000  single work  criticism       1 2   y    Rewriting God : Spirituality in Contemporary Australian Womens Fiction   Elaine Lindsay ,      Amsterdam  : Rodopi , 2000   Z797910 2000  selected work  criticism     Abstract Analyses womens spirituality in the larger context of Australian Desert Spirituality, concluding that women have been developing their own forms of religious expression.

These three writers have realised, in a way which is distinctive, an imaginative possession of and by place. Each of them has imaginatively taken hold of his/her own particular place and in so doing has found a way to belong. I do not say belong to Australia as a whole, because for them it does not exist as a single, cohesive entity. Rather these writers find their own features in their own particular place.

A delicious blend of fantasy and realism, it is a powerful, lyrical story of a childs rites of passage through a world where the family home, its garden, and the three women who preside over it, area vital and compelling participants in the shaping of a childs rituals of discovery and awareness. (UQP)","1   Households of Women - Two Recent Novels by Barbara Hanrahan   Phyllis Fahrie Edelson ,    single work  review     — Review of   Iris in Her Garden : Eight Stories  Barbara Hanrahan ,   1991  selected work  biography  short story      1   Australia in Three Books   Robert Lukins ,   2019  single work  review     — Appears in:       Meanjin  , Autumn vol.       78 no.      1    2019;   (p. 22-25)    Abstract I’ve heard of that place, Australia. There are even some memories that persist of it as a discrete, identifiable object. It was a thing taught to me in primary school in jovial, unambiguous ways. It was a series of tales of sheep, and rushes of gold, and the bushranging bloke with a metal bucket on his head. It played cricket against the West Indies. It was precisely 200 years old and we dressed as convicts and walked down the town’s main street to celebrate this fact. All incompleteness and lies that I felt disconnected from then, as I do now.  (Introduction)    1   The Sex Thing Is Strange : The Queerness of Barbara Hanrahan’s Fiction   Damien Barlow ,   2017  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Claiming Space for Australian Womens Writing    2017;   (p. 227-241)    Abstract This chapter explores Barbara Hanrahan’s notion that sexuality “can manifest itself in all sorts of ways” disrupts the naturalised binary logic that governs cultural intelligibility about what constitutes “real” sex and what remains unimaginable and unspeakable. It also highlights a preoccupation in her writing with non-normative sexual desires and identities that is akin to the critical concerns of queer epistemologies. The chapter takes Hanrahan’s contestation of normative thinking about sexuality as a starting point to critically examine the queerness of her “fantastic novels”. By reading Hanrahan’s fiction queerly we are offered a valuable critique that challenges the normalising power of heterosexuality and its claims to be the only intelligible and “natural” way to organise desire. Source: Abstract.    1   American Dreams and the University of Queensland Press   Deborah Jordan ,   2010  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Reading Across the Pacific : Australia-United States Intellectual Histories    2010;   (p. 323-338)    Abstract The University of Queensland Press was transformed from a merely scholarly into a creative independent Australian publisher partly through the agency of the American publisher Frank Thompson. In the explosive days of the late 1960s and early 1970s, and with Australians complex fascination with United States, Thompson embodied the democratic challenge to the old British dominated regime on campus and in publishing circles. This paper will explore pivotal books published by UQP notably Thomas Shapcotts Contemporary American and Australian Poetry in 1976; UQPs development of the American market with the distribution of UQP literary fiction and the establishment of an American office; and co-publishing with American publishers and editing Australian books for American readers in a different hemisphere. Thompsons own assessment of his successes and failures will be contextualised in terms of political developments and those issues long associated with Australian literature - environmental representation and expatriatism.

Masgrau-Peya argues that being unhoused for most of their adult lives, Mansfield and Hanrahan eschewed the comforts of either home or conventional family. Their writing, even when recognising the warmth and security of family and the comforts of home also acknowledges the politics of repression, exclusion and exploitation that make them possible.    1   In Sunshine or in Shadow   Kerryn Goldsworthy ,   2003  single work  prose     — Appears in:       The Adelaide Review  , March       no.      234    2003;   (p. 8)      1   White Gothic in Jane Eyre, Wide Sargasso Sea, and The Albatross Muff   Sue Thomas ,   2002  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Australian Cultural History  ,        no.      21    2002;   (p. 89-96, notes 122-124)      1   The Good Oil: Eucalypts and Murray Bails Eucalyptus   Lyn Jacobs ,   2001  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Antipodes  , June vol.       15 no.      1    2001;   (p. 40-44)      1   No Place Like Home : Living on the Edge of Oceania   Carol Merli ,   2001  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Changing Geographies : Essays on Australia    2001;   (p. 259-267)    Abstract Discusses how White Australia is haunted by a sense of being illegitimately in a place.

These three writers have realised, in a way which is distinctive, an imaginative possession of and by place. Each of them has imaginatively taken hold of his/her own particular place and in so doing has found a way to belong. I do not say belong to Australia as a whole, because for them it does not exist as a single, cohesive entity. Rather these writers find their own features in their own particular place. Theirs are alternative maps, not merely of Australia but of Brisbane and Adelaide and Bendigo, recreated according to their own experiences and the shaping force of these places on them.

Her father died of tuberculosis the day after her first birthday. She grew up in her grandmothers house in Rose St, Thebarton with her mother (a commercial artist), her grandmother and her grandmothers sister Reece, who had Down Syndrome, and this background features strongly in her writing. She was educated at Thebarton infant, primary and technical schools. In 1955 she moved to Oaklands Park with her mother and new stepfather. She attended the Adelaide Teachers College and the SA School of Art. Hanrahan began making prints in the early 1960s, and after teaching for a brief period she went to London (1963) and studied at the Central School of Art. After a year back in Adelaide she moved to London again in late 1965, and did not visit Australia again until 1973. As a child she had written and illustrated a novel, Emily of Sunnybrook, in an exercise book, basing it on L. M. Montgomerys Emily of New Moon. When she was about 19 she wrote stories for the Teachers College magazine, Torch. Then, when she started to make prints, words got into them . Whilst in London she began writing in earnest, when the death of her grandmother in 1968 awakened childhood memories. The old world was gone from me physically, yet it was inside my body, hurting so much it had to get out. While appreciating the warmth and security of her childhood home, she rejected what she saw as the suburban mediocrity and conditioned conformity of her mothers and grandmothers lives. She and her partner, the Adelaide sculptor Jo Steele, who had himself reacted strongly against family and social pressures, chose not to marry or have children. In 1975 she taught for a year at the SA School of Art, and in 1978 she and Jo returned from London to live in Adelaide. They set up their studios in Thebarton. Barbara was a prolific artist, producing more than 400 different prints over the years, as well as a number of paintings, and her work was exhibited in Australia, London and France. She held over 30 one-woman exhibitions. She was Writer in Residence at the University of Adelaide for a period in 1987, and later the same year, at Rollins College, Florida (USA). In 1991 Hanrahan died of cancer. The Barbara Hanrahan Fellowship, a writing fellowship, has been created by the Arts Division of the SA Department of the Arts and Cultural Heritage, and the University of South Australias City West campus has named the Barbara Hanrahan Building in her memory.",South Australian,,True,True,True,False

Riedl ,   Christine Davey ,   Christine Croyden ,   Duncan Esler ,   2022  single work  drama     Abstract Meet Alice Anderson – a gay mechanic and entrepreneur in 1920s Melbourne Meet Joy Hester – a fierce, angry, larger-than life artist in 1940s Melbourne Meet Elizabeth Gould – mother, lover, wife, artist of colonial Australia in the 1800s Meet Dawn Faizey-Webster – a woman with locked in syndrome completing her PhD with the blink of an eye. These remarkable women have been relegated to the sidelines of history and it’s time to bring them centre stage.

Performed by actor Claire Larisse Nicholls and directed by Sara Grenfell, the play takes the audience through a series of poignant and revelatory moments and Hester’s encounters with characters such as Sunday Reed, Albert Tucker, and Gray Smith. Poltergeists and dreams break through the piece theatrically and in a haunting soundscape with an original score performed by musician and composer Rosie Westbrook.

","1 5   y    Selected Letters of Hans Heysen and Nora Heysen   Hans Heysen ,   Nora Heysen ,      Canberra  : National Library of Australia , 2011   Z1813880 2011  selected work  correspondence     Abstract The prominent Australian artist Nora Heysen has been said to have worked in the shadow of her father Hans Heysen, one of Australias most recognised landscape painters. Letters between the two, however, reveal a different story. In 1934, when Nora first travelled to London to study art, she experienced her first time away from home and the first of many, often exotic places from where she would write home to Hahndorf, South Australia. The correspondence between Nora and Hans continued until his death in 1968. Theirs was a close and affectionate relationship, in which father and daughter shared a lifetime of thoughts about art and life, and a mutual admiration and respect for each others work. Heysen to Heysen is a showcase of letters between Nora and Hans Heysen from the collection of the National Library of Australia. Accompanied by carefully selected images and text by leading art historian Catherine Speck, the publication lifts the lid on a vista of Australian art.

As a young woman, her painting was extraordinary, but she could never get out from the shadow of her dad. She took her talents to London to carve her own identity, but male teachers and critics told her that her work wasn’t very good. It was. Back in Australia, Nora was the first woman to win Australia’s biggest portrait prize, the Archibald.  She was also the first woman to be sent to war as a war artist.  She documented many women at war, and in the last years of her life, was finally recognized as one of the finest portrait painters Australia has ever seen.  (Production summary)    1   Family Affair   Anne Loxley ,   2019  single work  column     — Appears in:       The Weekend Australian  , 9 March   2019;   (p. 6)    Abstract Nora Heysen struggled to emerge from her father Hans’s creative shadow, writes Anne Loxley     1   Hans and Nora Heysen : Two Generations of Australian Art   Miriam Cosic ,   2019  single work  column     — Appears in:       The Saturday Paper  , 23 March   2019;     Abstract While father and daughter Hans and Nora Heysen both became renowned Australian artists – he for bush landscapes, she for portraits and still lifes – their work had become, until recently, somewhat overlooked.

A portraitist and a flower painter, Nora Heysen’s life was defined by an all-consuming drive to draw and paint. In 1989, aged 78, Nora re-emerged on the Australian art scene as the nation’s major art institutions restored her position after years of artistic obscurity. Extensively researched by the author, Nora Heysen: A Portrait is the first biography of the artist, and it has been enthusiastically embraced by the Heysen family.

","1 2   y    Desert Lake : Art, Science and Stories from Paruku   Kim Mahood   (editor),   Mandy Martin   (editor),   John Carty   (editor),   Steve Morton   (editor),      Collingwood  : CSIRO Publishing , 2013   6889219 2013  anthology  non-fiction     Abstract Desert Lake is a book combining artistic, scientific and Indigenous views of a striking region of north-western Australia. Paruku is the place that white people call Lake Gregory. It is Walmajarri land, and its people live on their Country in the communities of Mulan and Billiluna.This is a story of water. When Sturt Creek flows from the north, it creates a massive inland Lake among the sandy deserts. Not only is Paruku of national significance for waterbirds, but it is has also helped uncover the past climatic and human history of Australia.The Walmajarri people of Paruku understand themselves in relation to Country, a coherent whole linking the environment, the people and the Law that governs their lives. These understandings are encompassed by the Waljirri or Dreaming and expressed through the songs, imagery and narratives of enduring traditions. ""Desert Lake"" is embedded in this broader vision of Country and provides a rich visual and cross-cultural portrait of an extraordinary part of Australia.

It is based on ‘deep-time’ complex human–landscape relationships from a highly significant lake system known as Paruku in the south-east Kimberley region. Known on cartographic charts as Lake Gregory, it is the only co-ordinated drainage system that flows from the east Kimberley into the expansive linear dune fields of the Great Sandy Desert. The lake was once a mega-lake, many times its current size, reflecting massive monsoonal rains more akin to central Indonesia than the present Kimberley desert edge. It hosted an enhanced aquatic and avian fauna and was likely a highly attractive lake for early settlers — being surrounded by savannah woodlands and grasses with grazing terrestrial fauna. Indeed, it was at such major water bodies that peoples transitioned into the desert hunter gatherer adaptations we think of today as the ethnographic norm. They persisted in an increasingly arid landscape — with lakes as a chain of connection to previous pluvial states. (Introduction)",Mandy Martin,,,,True,False,True,False

BiographyHistory

×Bio changes summary
Close

Born near the river at Old Texas Downs Station Western Australia, Queenie McKenzie was camp cook and station hand. Her mother Old Dinah (q.v.) was a Malngin/Gurindji woman. The police made several attempts to take Queenie McKenzie away but her mother rubbed her skin with charcoal and strongly defended her on separate occasions and managed to keep her daughter on the station. 
While living at Texas Downs Station, Queenie became friends with Rover Thomas who is a renowned artist. Queenie McKenzie was committed to inspiring young artists to paint and to keep their culture strong, she was instrumental in establishing the first wholly owned art centre for Gija artists in the Warmun community. To ensure the continued development of future generations of Warmun artists, the Warmun Art Centre was founded in August 1998.
In 1998 Queenie McKenzie was awarded the Western Australian State Living Treasures award for her services to reconciliation, art and teaching Gija (Kija) language by the Western Australian Government.

Queenie was an exceptional teacher, elder and internationally recognised artist. Written In The Land explores her personal story and that of her ""country"" through her own words with a narrative also by the author Jennifer Field and other ethnologist commentators. The book is illustrated throughout with reproductions of Queenies artisitic works and stunning landscape photos.

Sacred sites were damaged, and the people feared the effects of a large mining town nearby. Their attempts to use legislative rights were unsuccessful, the Sate Government of the day being firmly behind the mining company. This was a traumatic and divisive period. Nowadays members of the community prefer to emphasise their limited gains in negotiating protection of some of the sacred sites and obtaining some recompense from the company. They recognise that they had no hope of stopping the mine, and are relieved that many of the potential effects have been contained by ADMs avoidance of a town and control of its workers.    1   Gaining Confidence  1989  single work  oral history     — Appears in:       Impact Stories of the East Kimberley    1989;   (p. 95-99)    Abstract This was period in which individuals began to assert themselves publicly.    1   Developing Warmun Community  1989  single work  oral history     — Appears in:       Impact Stories of the East Kimberley    1989;   (p. 86-94)    Abstract Uncertainty about the future turned to pride as people faced the challenges of securing rights to remain at Turkey Creek, and building up the community with minimal resources. This was the first time many of the older people had had cash income of their own.    1   Leaving Stations, Starting Again  1989  single work  oral history     — Appears in:       Impact Stories of the East Kimberley    1989;   (p. 76-82)    Abstract The introduction of award wages was used as a rationalisation by many of the cattle stations in this area for evicting resident Aboriginal communities. Some workers were permitted to remain, but many chose to leave with their extended families. The pastoral industrys miscalculation that the workers they required would remain without their relations caused loss of its stable workforce. People moved to Halls Creek, Wyndham, and Turkey Creek (many Miriwoong and Gajirrawoong people were already in Kununurra following the flooding of Lake Argyle in the 1960s).    1   Race Relations  1989  single work  oral history     — Appears in:       Impact Stories of the East Kimberley    1989;   (p. 53-67)    Abstract The storytellers emphasise that there were both good and bad kartiya, people who treated them with constant consideration, as well as people known for violent behaviour. bad kartiya evidently had little risk of being found out. Police were represented in both categories, some intervening on Aborigines behalves, others killing Aboriginal people on occasions.    1   Murders and Massacres  1989  single work  oral history     — Appears in:       Impact Stories of the East Kimberley    1989;   (p. 1-11)    Abstract Kija and Miriwoong storytellers see their ancestors as having provoked the widespread killings by spearing lone white men.","1    y    Queenie McKenzie – the Girl Who Became a Living Treasure   Maree Yoelnu /specialistDatasets/BlackWords ,   Madison Lu   (presenter),      Canberra  : ABC Radio National , 2021   23476685 2021  single work  podcast     Abstract Queenie McKenzie grew up on a cattle station, staying away from the grasps of the authorities, who would take Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander kids like her from their families at will. As she grew up, she solved problems everywhere she saw them.  From building schools and teaching kids in her community, to saving a man’s life by repairing his scalp stitch by stitch. But deep down, she wanted to tell the stories of her Country. To preserve their importance. She started painting in her 70s – becoming the first woman in her community to do so – and realised the power of telling stories through art. And once she started, she never stopped.  (Production summary)    1    y    Bush Women   Darren Jorgensen   (editor),      Fremantle  : Fremantle Press , 2018   14503269 2018  anthology  biography     Abstract Bush Women is a collection of texts exploring the striking history of six Indigenous women artists from the Kimberley: from living on Country, to the arrival of Europeans, stations and missions, to the contemporary era of telephones and acrylic paints, their lives are as underscored by radical change as they are by the continuity of the Dreaming stories of their lands.Bush Women was published on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of a 1994 exhibition at Fremantle Arts Centre, featuring paintings by Daisy Andrews, Tjapartji Kanytjuri Bates, Tjingapa Davies, Paji Honeychild Yankkarr, Queenie McKenzie (Gara-Gara) and Pantjit Mary McLean. The contribution of these artists to the history of womens art in Western Australia and to the expression of 20th-Century Indigenous lived experience is far-reaching and continues to engage audiences in contemporary exhibitions, collections and archives.

Her mother Old Dinah (q.v.) was a Malngin/Gurindji woman. The police made several attempts to take Queenie McKenzie away but her mother rubbed her skin with charcoal and strongly defended her on separate occasions and managed to keep her daughter on the station. While living at Texas Downs Station, Queenie became friends with Rover Thomas who is a renowned artist. Queenie McKenzie was committed to inspiring young artists to paint and to keep their culture strong, she was instrumental in establishing the first wholly owned art centre for Gija artists in the Warmun community. To ensure the continued development of future generations of Warmun artists, the Warmun Art Centre was founded in August 1998.

",,"1   Aboriginal Women’s Portraiture : Margaret Olley and Julie Dowling   Donna Leslie /specialistDatasets/BlackWords ,   2022  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Journal of Australian Indigenous Issues  , December vol.       25 no.      3-4    2022;   (p. 58-70)    Abstract Portraits of Australian Aboriginal women have historically reflected artistic styles, changing perceptions and the unique characteristics of the individual artist, but it was not until the 1950s that Aboriginal women began to be presented by Australian portraitists in a more humanistic and holistic way. In the 1960s, a shift took place in the way Aboriginal women were portrayed, when the Australian artist Margaret Olley [1923-2011] focused upon Aboriginal women differently. She imaged Aboriginal women in terms of painterly aesthetics, ignoring the societal, racial and historical meanings that could have been symbolically attached to her imagery if she had chosen to do so. This article focuses firstly on Olley’s contribution and its interpretation by the Gamilaroi art historian, Donna Leslie. It then extends the investigation of Aboriginal womens portraiture in contemporary Australian art through the exploration of a select group of paintings by the portraitist Julie Dowling (1969-), of the Badimaya people of Western Australia. This article is written by an Indigenous Australian author.

But she loved to paint and found beauty in the everyday things around her. Margaret became one of Australia’s most loved artists and her paintings are famous around the world. Narrated by actor and producer Deborra-lee Furness.

He visited again from time to time in later years. His friend Donald Murray remained in the cottage until his death in 1988, for Russell Drysdale and Friend had combined to purchase the cottage for him, Friends stays in Hill End, and the extended stays by artist friends such as Russell Drysdale and Margaret Olley, transformed the almost deserted ex-goldmining town into the artists colony it remains to this day. According to the local shopkeeper, the population of the town today is 117. In 1872, at the height of the gold rush, the population was anywhere between 10,000 and 30,000, depending on whom you believe.

In the days before Olley died at home in July 2011, the artist agreed to a project to reconstruct her studio at the Tweed River Art Gallery in northeastern NSW, the region in which she was born. Three rooms from her home will be recreated there: the ""Hat Factory"" where Olley painted and entertained; the ""Yellow Room"", with its Matisse posters and rugs; and the kitchen.

      2 10   y    Margaret Olley : Far from a Still Life   Meg Stewart ,      Milsons Point  : Random House Australia , 2005   Z1220833 2005  single work  biography     Abstract Margaret Olleys life began in the tropics of north Queensland on a cane and dairy farm. But her family was soon on the move, first to the Tweed in New South Wales, then to Brisbane. During her last years at school, Margarets artistic talent became apparent and she was encouraged to apply to study art formally. So, in Sydney in the early 1940s, her life-long love affair with painting began. Here, too, she met artists such as Russell Drysdale, Donald Friend, David Strachan and William Dobell, with whom she would form enduring friendships. In 1948 William Dobell asked if she would sit for him and the resulting portrait won the Archibald Prize, just as she was setting off overseas. Bohemian adventures in Europe followed. Margaret travelled - sketch book in hand - in England, France, Italy and Spain, and lived on a vineyard in Cassis in the south of France. But in 1953 she returned to Australia struggling with her drinking and was forced to choose to dry out or dry up creatively. Once shed made her decision, her return to life and painting was joyous. Nowadays, despite a recent bout of profound depression, when not only did she want to give up painting but also living, she still produces magnificent art, donates to our galleries and entertains in her notoriously cluttered Paddington terrace in Sydney.

","1   The Tale of the Seven Magpies   Angela Rega ,   2021  short story     — Appears in:       South of the Sun : Australian Fairy Tales for the 21st Century    2021;   (p. 223-229)      1   Be-yond Becoming : The Shared Features of Art-making and Constructing a Narrative of the Imagined Future   Debra Phillips ,   Elaine Lindsay ,   2018  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Life Writing  ,  vol.       15 no.      1    2018;   (p. 107-119)    Abstract Both art-making and creating a ‘Narrative of the Imagined Future’ call on the imagination to conceive a finished object before beginning its construction. Both processes open a way into the unknown, where one searches for what could become real. In this paper I employ an auto-ethnographic approach to demonstrate the similarities between art-making and the writing of a self-narrative, referencing my double portrait, ‘Be-yond Becoming’ (which draws on van Eyck’s ‘The Arnolfini Portrait’), and the circumstances behind its generation. Narratives are powerful vehicles. As we tell the story of who we want to become we set ourselves to live out that story. The virtual is actualised and the imagined is made real. In this instance, I outline how a rupture in my self-narrative allowed another self-narrative to emerge. Art-practice guided me out of an episode of depression as I replaced my self-narrative of being a failed teacher with a new self-narrative, that of becoming an artist. Source: Publishers blurb.    1   Using Diary Writing : A Narrative of Radical Courage   Debra Phillips ,   Elaine Lindsay ,   2017  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       TEXT Special Issue Website Series  ,        no.      38    2017;     Abstract This article considers the use of diary entries as primary source material in autoethnographic research. It examines how the act of diary writing can reveal a trajectory into, and away from, an experience of depression and how diary entries can provide grounds for conjecture about possible futures and imagined self-narratives. It describes how ‘radical courage’, as identified by Phillips, can displace suicidal ideation and bolster a new self-narrative of an imagined future. The article highlights the value of diaries. More than a source of raw data for research and creative writing projects, they offer diarists a safe place to explore and create alternative and productive selfnarratives. In their unedited state, they are a first-person, present-tense record of emotional states, showing how context and events impact upon an individual’s life. Diary entries can reveal to the diarist and researcher alike the beginnings of a new selfnarrative that is not yet fully imagined nor articulated. The article includes selected diary entries and reflections on depression as a lived experience to show the connection between radical courage and a narrative of the future. This narrative form – a narrative of the imagined future – is commended for its therapeutic potential as a cognitive strategy to build resilience. Through writing and speaking, the story develops as it is lived; by being lived, the story becomes embodied.

","1   Unmapping the End of the World   Jonathan Kimberley ,   Yhonnie Scarce /specialistDatasets/BlackWords ,   2015  single work  essay     — Appears in:       Artlink  , June vol.       35 no.      2    2015;   (p. 20-25)","1   Listen to the People Who Know’ : Nuclear Colonial Memory in the Work of Natalie Harkin and Yhonnie Scarce   Robert Newton ,   2023  single work  criticism     — Appears in:       Australian Literary Studies  , 2 May vol.       38 no.      1    2023;     Abstract In this article, I ask how the British nuclear humanities, and in particular literary studies, might turn towards Indigenous Australian artistic, literary and critical work on nuclear legacies. Reading responses to the afterlives of British nuclear operations at Maralinga by the activist-poet Dr Natalie Harkin (Narungga) and the artist Yhonnie Scarce (Kokatha / Nukunu), I consider how, for British scholars, interpreting Aboriginal nuclear texts asks particular questions of critical practice, drawing attention to empire’s intellectual, as well as social and chemical, residues. Such work invites a reflexive critical approach, attentive to what feminist and Indigenous scholars call ‘positionality’. In Britain, the places blasted and irradiated in the name of national defence have a vague, occluded presence in collective memory. This inhibited awareness of nuclear history, I suggest, has been shaped both by avoidant attitudes to empire, and also by strongly future-oriented nuclear imaginaries. By contrast, Harkin and Scarce draw attention to intimate, ongoing encounters with toxic legacies left by imperial and settler-colonial projects. As they celebrate the resilience of dispossessed, poisoned communities for whom nuclear apocalypse is an everyday reality, they emphasise interrelated forms of responsibility: to the past, to land, and to future generations. I discuss the important challenges that their art and activism present to mainstream nuclear cultures, and to the memory of empire in Britain.  (Publication abstract)     1   Australian History Put through the Looking Glass by Aboriginal Artists Judy Watson and Yhonnie Scarce in New Exhibition   Hannah Reich ,   2020  single work  column     — Appears in:       ABC News [Online]  , December   2020;     Abstract There are certain works of art that are impossible to ignore, that have a magnetic pull that can be felt from anywhere in a gallery.

After moving to Hobart in 1980 she graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1982. Watson has also lectured at the Townsville College of TAFE and at the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education. She has exhibited her artwork both nationally and internationally. In 2006 two of her works were permanently installed within the archetectural fabric of the Musee du quai Branly in Paris. Watson has also been a recipient of several contemporary art awards including the Moet and Chandon Fellowship in 1995 and the National Gallery of Victoria's Clemenger Award in 2006.

We travel through these archives that offer up new stories and collections of data, and a brutal surveillance is exposed at the hands of the State. We gain insight into intimate conversations, letters, behaviours and movements, juxtaposed with categorisations of people, places, landscapes and objects. These records are our memories and lives; material, visceral, flesh and blood. The State wounds and our records bleed. I travel through my own Nanna’s records and recognise that we have never lived outside the State, and this very act of recognition continues the wounding. State acts of surveillance, recording and archiving had the power to place ourfamily stories in the public domain, or obliterate stories within a broader history of erasure; filed away, silent and hidden until bidden. But our bodies too are archives where memories, stories, and lived experiences are stored, etched and anchored in our bloodlines deep. They ground our creativity in what become personal and political acts of remembering, identity making and speaking back to the State. Detective-like methods allow us to creatively re-map events and landscapes, piece together lives fragmented and heal our wounds. ((Re) Mapping the Archive, 4)",Judy Watson,In 1990 Judy Watson who is a descendant of the Waanyi clan was able to fulfil her life-long dream of researching her Aboriginal heritage by travelling to her grandmothers country in north-west Queensland. Watson grew up in Brisbane and attended the Darling Downs Institute of Advanced Education in Toowoomba where she gained a Diploma of Creative Arts in 1979. After moving to Hobart in 1980 she graduated from the University of Tasmania in 1982. Watson has also lectured at the Townsville College of TAFE and at the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education.
